One question I have about the implementation of the stretch problem before getting into analysis
is that on line 88 they are seemingly attempting to use a register to store an array, I thought via module \
lectures that registers were only able to hold single values, so not sure exactly how this works or if it works. 

Something I find particularly impressive about this implementation is the care put into validation and testing
results, I generally just did my testing by observing console output without writing detailed tests which are included in the stretch. 

Additionally I appreciate the implementation of flags for setting debug output to be included or excluded, this is 
a practice that is undoubtedly useful but I rarely find myself taking the time to include it in my own assignments. 

Another positive aspect of the stretch implementation is the inclusion of performance testing via timed executions.

Lastly the inclusion of multiple different types of memory and the modularization of breaking up copying to/from
each type of memory makes this implementation easy to read.
