Complete stretch problem, which for this assignment means to review the code below 
and recognize at least one major element of your assignment that this code does 
not perform.  

Presume that this is all that was submitted but that it compiled and 
ran correctly. If there are elements that you like state them as well.


The included implementation of this problem does not include a number of things that 
my implementation does. Firstly, the included implementation only has functionality 
for adding arrays utilizing shared memory, I incldued functionality for addition,
subtraction, multiplication, and division. Next, when looking at constant memory this 
stretch solution doesn't include static constants in the header like I did, following
the implementation in the provided constant_memory.cu
