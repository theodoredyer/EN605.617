- For this assignment I chose to practice implementing rand and solve

Note on performance times - I'm unsure as to why the larger matrix random generation is taking less time than the smaller matrix generation in my testing environment, possible due to resources already being spun up and losing that re-initialization time on the second execution. 

Additionally, the time to solve the 3x3 matrix provided seems to be larger than I would have initially thought, although on some level this does make sense as it is a much more complex operation than what we've seen prior.
